	Objective
	</h1>
	<p>
		To give a very simple pictorial guide to a geographical locations and maps of countries across the world.
	</p>
	<h2>
	Website and Target Audience
	</h2>
	<p>
		The website presents the audience with a grid of flags from 20 different countries. When the user clicks on a flag, either the geographical
		location, the map or the emblem of that country is shown in viewport. The user can choose between the location, the map and emblem by clicking
		on the buttons provided in the heading.
		</br>
		The target audience for this website are children under the age of 10. I think this would be a handy and interactive tool for children to learn
		geography.
	</p>
	<h2>
	Design Considerations and Aesthetics
	</h2>
	<p>
		When the user clicks on a flag, my plan was to have a slideshow of different pictures that say something about the country. I couldn't figure
		out how to do that, so I decided to have buttons in the heading that will give the user choice to switch between different information about
		the countries. I was going to store images in the mysql database, after some research I found out that it was bad practice. Instead I decided 
		to store the path name to each of the images in the database. In order to first populate the database I created a csv document which the php
		code will read and load into the database. This information is then accessed as needed.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wanted the background to be the world map and have it stay fixed while user scrolls through the content, this gives the page a very sophisticated
		look and I am glad that I was able to implement this functionality. Using lightbox to display images on click was also something I planned. When I
		started out I did not even know that the implementation was called lightbox, after a few failed google searches I found out.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also wanted to include more information, like major festivels, important buildings etc. I did not have the time and resources to collect all the data. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>
		Description of the client-side user interactivity.
	</h2>
	<p>
		The client interaction is very simple. The user only needs to click on desired buttons/links to the access information.
	</p>
	
	<h2>
		Nature of information exchange with the server.
	</h2>
	<p>
		There is only one way information exchange. When the page loads, all the required information to run the website is received from the server.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Operations performed on the server.
	</h2>
	<p>
		The paths to different images are all read from the csv file and stored in a database. This database is then accessed through php and the 
		html code is generated and sent to the user.
